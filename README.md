This material includes the Piano Robot project from Texas Tech University Project Lab 4 class from Fall 2016 by Jason Mamed and hardware designer Kevin Galvan.

#I will update this soon (2/2/2017)

#This repository includes all of the files of the Texas Tech University Project Lab 4 project Piano Robot.
#The Piano Robot project was built and designed by Kevin Galvan (Hardware) and the software programmer Jason Mamed.
#The project description was to design and build a pair of independent robotic hands to play the electric keyboard.
#The Raspberry Pi 3 (using Rasbian OS) was used as the Microcontroller for the robotic hands.
#Controlled by an iOS application built by Jason Mamed, using Firebase (database) as the "control point" of the project users were able to pick which song they wanted the robotic hands to play.

#Final version was the TTU_Lab4_PianoRobot_Mamed.py file.
